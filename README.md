## Gaudi-v2: For recommendation models

This repository is designed for implementing and testing recommendation models using Gaudi-v2.

Currently, we have implemented three recommendation models:
- [**PMF**](https://github.com/Sein-Kim/Gaudi-Git/tree/main/MF-gaudi): A collaborative filtering-based recommendation model.
- [**SASRec**](https://github.com/Sein-Kim/Gaudi-Git/tree/main/SASRec-gaudi): Another collaborative filtering-based recommendation model.
- [**A-LLMRec**](https://github.com/Sein-Kim/Gaudi-Git/tree/main/A-LLMRec-gaudi): An LLM-based recommendation model.
