## Gaudi-v2: For recommendation models

This repository is designed for implementing and testing recommendation models using Gaudi-v2.

Currently, we have implemented three recommendation models:
- **PMF**: A collaborative filtering-based recommendation model.
- **SASRec**: Another collaborative filtering-based recommendation model.
- **A-LLMRec**: An LLM-based recommendation model.
